# Performance Optimizations Summary

## Changes Made to Improve Listing Generation Speed

### 1. Lambda Configuration (Backend)
Update these environment variables in your AWS Lambda function:
- `USE_BATCHING=true` - Enables batch processing
- `BATCH_SIZE=5` - Process up to 5 listings per API call

### 2. Frontend Parallel Processing (PhotoAssignmentReview.jsx)
- **Before**: Sequential processing - each listing waited for the previous one to complete
- **After**: Batch parallel processing - processes 5 listings concurrently

#### Key Improvements:
1. **Batch Processing**: Groups listings into batches of 5
2. **Concurrent API Calls**: Each batch processes all listings simultaneously using `Promise.all()`
3. **Progress Tracking**: Updates progress after each batch completes
4. **Optimized Image Conversion**: Uses parallel image processing with `Promise.all()`

### Expected Performance Gains
For 80 images (40 listings):
- **Before**: ~40 sequential API calls (one at a time)
- **After**: ~8 batch operations with 5 concurrent calls each
- **Estimated Speed Improvement**: 3-5x faster

### How It Works
1. Listings are grouped into batches of 5
2. Each batch processes all 5 listings concurrently
3. Progress updates after each batch completes
4. Error handling preserved for individual listings

### Next Steps
1. Deploy the Lambda environment variable changes
2. Test with your 80-image sample to verify performance improvements
3. Consider adjusting BATCH_SIZE based on your Lambda's memory and timeout settings
4. Monitor CloudWatch logs for any rate limiting issues
